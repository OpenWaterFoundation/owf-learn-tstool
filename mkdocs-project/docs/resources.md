## TSTool Documentation ##

The local copy of documentation that is installed with TSTool is always the most current for that version of the software.
However, OWF is beginning to move documentation to online navigable forms such as this documentation.
Online PDF versions are available below:

* [User Manual](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdss-staging/tstool/downloads/latest/TSTool-Vol1-UserManual.pdf) - overview of software and installation appendix (~250 pages)
* [Command Reference](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdss-staging/tstool/downloads/latest/TSTool-Vol2-CommandReference.pdf) - documentation for every TSTool command (~750 pages, alphabetized)
* [Datastore Reference](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdss-staging/tstool/downloads/latest/TSTool-Vol3-DatastoreReference.pdf) - explains data sources (~150 pages, alphabetized)
